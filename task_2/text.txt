BCS28a: Fall 2025 STUDENT HANDOUT 

Build Your Own RAG System (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) 

Group Project — 16 Groups, 5 Students per Group 

Shape 

1. Project Purpose 

In the remaing of this course you will learn one of the most important AI techniques: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You (group) will learn independently, by building a RAG system in the end yourself in Python. Each week, any group may be randomly selected to present—be prepared at all times. (Note: This document is a simple guideline and will be modified quite frequently till the end of semester).  

Shape 

2. Deliverables (in the Weeks of 4-8) 

Each group must prepare and be ready all lecutre to be called for a presentation: 

A 12–15 minute presentation 

A Python notebook or script 

A complet working RAG system that includes (at the end of the semester): 

Text chunking 

Embedding generation 

Vector search (FAISS, ChromaDB, or cosine similarity) 

Retrieval 

A custom prompt using retrieved text 

LLM answer generation 

Shape 

3. Project Tasks (by lecture weeks) 

Task 1 — Prompt Engineering (November 29, 2025. Week 4) 

(Each group) Learns and demonstrates: 

LLM Limitations: The issues of LLMs, primarily hallucination and knowledge cutoff. 

The RAG Concept: Introduce RAG as a solution. Explain the two main stages: Retrieval and Generation è Then move to Prompt Engineering: 

Zero-shot and few-shot prompting 

Chain-of-thought 

Why LLMs hallucinate 

Why retrieval improves answers 

Required Output: 
3–5 prompt examples, including one that fails without retrieval. By the end of Week 4, that is November 29, 2025 (having listened from 4-6 groups) everyone expected to learn or have a clear idea of: 

Why there is a need for RAG? (What are the limitations of LLMs?) 

What actually  RAG is? 

What is prompt engineering and how it is done best? 

Demonstrate examples of good prompt engineering practices.

Task 2 — Embeddings & Vector Search (Week 5) 

Steps: 

Choose a dataset (PDFs, articles, documentation, etc.) 

Split text into chunks 

Generate embeddings 

Store embeddings in a vector database 

Implement similarity searchz 

Retrieve top-k chunks for a query 

Required Output: 
A query → retrieved top-k similar text chunks. 

Shape 

Task 3 — Build Your RAG Pipeline (Week 6) 

Connect all steps: 

Prepare a simple user Inteface (similar to that of Gemini, OpenAI, or DeepSeek) 

Let user enters a question (put a prompt) 

Vector search searches the relevant chunks (similarity search) 

Must use at least 3 different data format (pdf, video, image, text, web-content, etc.) 

Retrieved text is inserted into a prompt template for LLM 

Prompt is sent to an LLM 

A final answer is produced 

Required Output: 
Show one question that fails without retrieval but succeeds with RAG. 

Shape 

Task 4 — Use LangChain or LlamaIndex (Week 7-8) 

After understanding RAG’s core components, you may rebuild your pipeline with a framework. 

Required Output: 
Explain what the framework automates compared to your manual implementation. 

Shape 

4. Group FINAL Presentation Guidelines  

Your 13–15 minute presentation must include: 

Clear explanation of RAG concepts 

Each member speaks at least once 

Live demo of your RAG system 

A failure example (no retrieval) 

A success example (with retrieval) 

Reflection: What was difficult or surprising? 

Any group can be called at any time.

8. Summary 

You will learn RAG by building it yourself. 
You must be able to explain each component clearly and demonstrate your system live. 
Any group may be asked to present without warning both for the weeks of 5 to 8 and for the final presenations — prepare accordingly.
